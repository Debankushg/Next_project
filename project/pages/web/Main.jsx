          <summary> Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert.</summary> It may be made
          from dairy milk or cream and is flavoured with sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such
          as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored
          cream base and liquid nitrogen together. Colorings are sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers.
